Simple little test to see if I can get pygame working with a small
library coded in C to access the draw buffer directly.

When running, hit "f" to show the framerate. Escape to quit.

Requirements:
  pygame
  numpy

Build:
  gcc -c -Wall -O2 -fPIC c_drawer.c
  gcc -shared c_drawer.o -o c_drawer.so

Run:
  python pyg_c.py
